# Chopstick data analysis
This project is an assignment of the Udacity [Nanodegree Data Analyst](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002).

##Project Overview
A few researchers set out to determine the optimal length of chopsticks for children and adults. They came up with a measure of how effective a pair of chopsticks performed, called the "Food Pinching Performance." The "Food Pinching Performance" was determined by counting the number of peanuts picked and placed in a cup (PPPC).

Following questions are answered in this project:
1. What is the independent variable in the experiment?
2. What is the dependent variable in the experiment?
3. How is the dependent variable operationally defined?
4. Which chopstick length performed the best for the group of thirty-one male junior college students?

This is coverd in the project:
1.  A scatterplot with the data is generated.

##Run
